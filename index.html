<h2>BIOFEEDBACK: A technology studied, approved, and safe</h2>

<div class="InfoBoxBiofeedback">
    Biofeedback is a therapy solution brought back in 1969, aiming to combine therapy and the new word of cybernetics. 
    The process involves treatment designed to allow self-regulation for the subject of various bodily functions through electronic monitoring of bodily functions, 
    and to share this monitoring with the subject.

    <br><br>An open communication with the subject is provided.

<h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Technology hoping to merge with us</h2>
<div class="InfoBoxAI">
    The newest waves of technology does not hope to take over human strength and laborious tasks like the steam train did before it. 
    <br>
    The technology focuses instead on less practical goal for more cost. Little reward for a grand cost - taking over human focused areas such as art and innovation
